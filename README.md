# hfoss-project-2018f

This is a starting point for the HFOSS project for the fall 2018. 
The goal of this project is to explore several open source projects that are humanitarian in nature and figure out how to make contributions to those projects. 

There are three main participants in the project. They keep blogs with regular updates about what is going on. You can see their blogs at:
- [Isabelle](https://nyu-hfoss-project.github.io/thefifthisa-blog/) 
- [Flavia](https://nyu-hfoss-project.github.io/fasinha-blog/)
- [Owura](https://nyu-hfoss-project.github.io/owura82-blog/)

## September 1 - October 10 Summary

We performed project evaluation of more than [15 different projects](https://gist.github.com/joannakl/dca5bd0d3521d12ece4ae13add4ae22b). The summaries can be found on the blogs above. 

Based on the evaluations and the interest of participants, we narrowed down the scope of our work to:
- OpenMRS
- Open Street Maps
- Anthropy 

We encountered some problems with OpenMRS installation. 
Anthropy installation was successful (???) for everybody.
